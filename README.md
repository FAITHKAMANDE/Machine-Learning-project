# Machine-Learning-project
## OVERVIEW
This project focuses on predicting which customers are likely to stop using a telecom company's services (customer churn). The dataset consists of 3,333 customer records, containing details such as call usage, subscription plans, and customer service interactions.
The main goal is to build a machine learning classification model that can proactively identify customers at risk of churn. Early identification enables the company to take targeted actions — like offering personalized services or special deals — to retain valuable customers.
By analyzing usage behavior, plan details, and customer service interactions, we aim to discover key patterns and insights that contribute to customer churn, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.

## BUSINESS QUESTION 
"Which customer behaviors and service factors most influence churn in a telecommunications company, and how accurately can we predict churn to drive proactive customer retention strategies?"
## OBJECTIVE
- Develop a binary classification model to predict customer churn.
- Identify and rank the most significant features influencing churn.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
- Provide actionable insights into customer behaviors that lead to churn.
- Recommend targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and increase customer lifetime value.
- Enable the telecom company to proactively intervene with at-risk customers, improving overall customer satisfaction.
